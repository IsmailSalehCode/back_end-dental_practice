Back end for a SPA I deployed in May 2022 on a shared-hosting Namecheap server. Client was a dental practice.

Features: Registration, Authentication, Authorization, CRUD & Communication with an external API (Google reCAPTCHA).

In 2023 I submitted an updated version of this project as proof-of-expertise for the discipline "Програмиране за интернет" (direct translation from Bulgarian: 'Programming for Internet') during my undergraduate program. Here is a link to a dev manual I wrote for the assistant professor at TU-Sofia to run my project: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rb45B2FMVi5wmHWlY_bhH45uL6f0-kZ9/view?usp=sharing <br>
